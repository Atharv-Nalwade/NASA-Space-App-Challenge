Feature 1:- 

*Adjust Spectrogram Parameters*: You can fine-tune the spectrogram parameters for better results. The `n_fft` (number of FFT points) and `hop_length` (hop size) values can significantly affect the quality of the spectrogram and, consequently, the audio. Experiment with different values to find what works best for your images. 

Feature 2:- 

*Enhance Image Preprocessing*: The code currently scales the image's pixel values to a fixed range (-50 to 30 dB) and converts it to amplitude. Depending on your input images, you might want to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, such as contrast stretching or histogram equalization, to enhance the features in the spectrogram.
