Feature 1:- 

*Adjust Spectrogram Parameters*: You can fine-tune the spectrogram parameters for better results. The `n_fft` (number of FFT points) and `hop_length` (hop size) values can significantly affect the quality of the spectrogram and, consequently, the audio. Experiment with different values to find what works best for your images. 

Feature 2:- 

*Enhance Image Preprocessing*: The code currently scales the image's pixel values to a fixed range (-50 to 30 dB) and converts it to amplitude. Depending on your input images, you might want to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, such as contrast stretching or histogram equalization, to enhance the features in the spectrogram. 

Feature 3:- 

3. *Improve Griffin-Lim Reconstruction*: Griffin-Lim is a basic algorithm for inverting a magnitude spectrogram back into the time domain. You can explore more advanced methods like WaveGAN or MelGAN for higher-quality audio generation. These models have shown significant improvements over Griffin-Lim.

Feature 4:- 

4. *Parameter Tuning*: Fine-tune the parameters like `time` and `n_iter` based on the nature of your input images and the desired audio output. For example, you might need more iterations for complex images or longer audio clips.
    The ideal value for n_iter (the number of iterations for the Griffin-Lim algorithm) can vary depending on the complexity of the image and the desired quality of the resulting audio. It's often an empirical value that you might need to experiment with based on the characteristics of your specific use case. 

    Low Values (e.g., 10-30):  low iterations. fast processing. and low quality of audio generation. 

    Medium Values (e.g., 30-50):  balance range to start with. Suitable for many cases. 

    High Values (e.g., 50-100 or more):  high iterations, high quality of audio. escepillay used for highly complex images.
